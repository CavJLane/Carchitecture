# Cameron's Cars Application Refactor & Feature Implementation Log

## Application Goals
- Display all Cars as cards, with all mapped information (brand, driver, fleets, sensors, modes, etc.)
- Filter Cars by Fleet, Brand, and Driver
- Completeness and validity checks (red/yellow borders)
- Detailed car view overlay with sections, add/remove, and advanced view
- All data and relationships as described in the data structure rules

### Log
- **CarCard.vue**: Created a minimal, well-documented card component to display all mapped information for a Car, with border color indicating completeness/validity. Emits an event to open the detailed car view.
- **useCarChecks.ts**: Added a composable with functions to check completeness and validity for a Car, following all outlined rules.

**Next steps:**
- Implement FilterBar.vue and filtering logic in App.vue
- Begin work on CarDetailOverlay.vue and supporting reusable components
- Continue updating this log as progress continues.
